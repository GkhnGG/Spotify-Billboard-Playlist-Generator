# Spotify Billboard Playlist Generator

This Python script generates a private Spotify playlist based on Billboard Hot 100 songs from a specific date.

## Overview

## Prerequisites

Before running the script, you need to set up your Spotify API credentials. Copy `config.template` to `config.py` and fill in your Spotify Client ID, Client Secret, Redirect URI, and Username.
